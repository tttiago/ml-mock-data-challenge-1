# MLGWSC-1 - Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search (Mock Data) Challenge

## Introduction

In the first machine learning gravitational-wave search mock data challenge ([MLGWSC-1](https://github.com/gwastro/ml-mock-data-challenge-1)) participants are tasked with finding gravitational-wave signals of varying complexity in a noisy background. Entries are evaluated on metrics which are used to 
classify the performance of real-world, state-of-the-art search 
algorithms.
